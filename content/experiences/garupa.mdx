description: Development, maintenance and build of the app mobile Garupa for passengers, developed in react-native, redux and redux-saga. Application that had an average of 15.000 rides a day, reaching 450.000 rides a month and being the main product of the entire company. In this work I used a lot the agile methodology that we call 'scrumban' and I learned a lot about the concepts of build and distribution in the app store and play store and release versions for testing in the firebase app.
