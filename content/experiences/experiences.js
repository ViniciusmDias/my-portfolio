    description: 'During my return to V4, I spearheaded the automation of processes and  CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions and AWS, establishing a robust  Kubernetes infrastructure to support both production and staging  environments. I initiated the adoption of serverless solutions via AWS Lambda Functions, managing all deployment processes for staging and  production environments. Additionally, I played a pivotal role as a  co-technical lead, sharing leadership responsibilities and technical  guidance, closely collaborating with another tech lead in driving  strategic projects and making key technological decisions.',
